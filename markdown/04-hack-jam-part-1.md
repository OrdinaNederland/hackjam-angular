## TODO: Implement the features in your app

[Final app](http://hackjam.hackages.io)

    - Learn about structural directive
    - Learn how to create a class and create a typed array in TypeScript
 - Display all books on the main area
    - Learn about property bindings
 - On click on a category, update the list of books and change the class to selected
    - The filter should be apply to the category of the book
    - The css class should be applied to the anchor:

 - On click on the filter button, open the sidebar filter component
 - Implement the search
    - Learn about `Forms` and `NgModel`
    - The search should be applied to the title and the category
